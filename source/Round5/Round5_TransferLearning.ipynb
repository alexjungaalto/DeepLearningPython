    "Assume you want to build an app that distinguishes between different dog breeds (see this [overview](https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/profiles)). This can be modeled as a classification problem which we can solve using a deep neural network. Indeed, we could train a deep neural network to predict the dog breed based on a large set of labeled images. The problem is that the amount of labeled images required for accurate training scales with the number of weights (and bias terms) of the deep net. It might well be that we do not have enough training images for some (rare) breeds.\n",

    "The idea of transfer learning is to exploit similarities between different machine learning problems. Loosely speaking, transfer learning allows to borrow statistical power from related problems for which we can collect more labeled data than for the (\"target\") problem at hand. \n",

    "For the dog breed classification problem, such a similar problem could be the classification of images as dog or cat (see Round 4). We might have access to large image databases of dog and cat images so we can reliably tune the weights of a deep net. If we have found weights for a deep net that allow to distinguish between dog and cat images, it might be a good starting point for adjusting the weights to further distinguish between different dog breeds. \n",

    " \n",
    "Transfer learning is a machine learning technique in which model trained for one particular task is used as a starting point for training model for another task. Transfer learning enables us to utilize the knowledge (such as learned weights, features) from previously learned tasks and apply it to the new, but related task.  \\\n",
    "For example, for image classification task certain low-level features, such as edges, shapes, corners and intensity, do not appears to be specific to a particular dataset or particular task. Such learned features can be shared across different image classification problems, thus enabling knowledge transfer among them. Following figure demonstrates the difference between traditional machine learning and transfer learning.\n",

    "# Why Transfer Learning ?\n",
    "Deep learning models are data-hungry - they need many training examples to learn the parameters of the network. This is one of the limiting aspects of deep neural networks and that is why the transfer learning comes in handy. Transfer learning is a common and highly effective approach to train the model on a small image dataset by  utilising **pre-trained models**.  Furthermore, transfer learning helps to save the training time, because the model is not trained from scratch. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-trained model** is a deep learning architecture which is trained over a large dataset. Such models are trained for thousands of hours for a given benchmark dataset and all the parameters in the networks are learned. There are numbers of such pre-trained models available and anyone can use them depending on the particular problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Few examples of pre-trained models are:\n",

    "# Key considerations for Transfer Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "To effectively apply transfer learning we need to answer three main questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **What to transfer**: While applying transfer learning we need to understand what knowledge is common between the source and target task. We try to seek answer on what knowledge is specific to source task and what can be transferred from source task to target task that will help improve the performance of the target task. \n",
    "-  **When to transfer**: We should apply transfer learning only when source and target domain are related. When  source and target domains are not related at all, applying transfer learning degrades target task performance. This type of transfer is called Negative Transfer. \n",
    "- **How to transfer**: Once we have answer to what to transfer and when to transfer, we can proceed to identify the actual ways of transferring the knowledge across domains/tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "**So, when does transfer learning makes sense?** \n",
    "\n",
    "If we are trying to learn from **Task A** and transfer knowledge to **Task B**, transfer learning is useful in following scenario:\n",
    "- Task A and B have same input x, e.g both have images as input. \n",
    "- There is alot more data for Task A than Task B.\n",

    "# Transfer Learning Strategies\n",
    "There are two common ways to use pre-trained models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To use pre-trained model as a feature extractor\n",
    "2. To fine-tune the pre-trained model \n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-trained Models as a Feature Extractors\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in Round 3, convolutional neural network consists of two parts: first part being the series of  convolutional and pooling layers and second part being densely connected layers. The first part is called **convolutional base**. The main idea of using pre-trained model as feature extractor is to remove a fully connected layer of pre-trained model and use only convolutional base to extract the features from new images.\\\n",
    "These extracted features will be used to train a new classifier for a new task. In this case, we do not retrain pre-trained model or part of it (this is called **freezing** the network), but only train few top dense layers. In other words, the model will only have to learn the weights of the few new dense layers, that are on the top of pre-trained model.\\\n",
    "Figure below demonstrates the concept of feature extraction from pre-trained model and following training of a classifier on top of it. \\\n",
    "For example, if we have a pre-trained model trained on source data like ImageNet database (over 14 million images), we chop off the densely connected layer and use this convolutional base to extract the feature from target data (i.e data for new classification task). Specifically, this means to use the output of convolutional base for training the new (target) model. \\\n",
    "$ $\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <img src=\"feature_extract.png\" alt=\"drawing\"/ align='middle'/>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Fine-tuning the pre-trained model \n",
    "In this case we do not just replace and retrain the classifier head, i.e fully connected layers, but we also selectively re-train some of the top layers used for feature extraction in pre-trained model. This process is called **fine-tuning** because it slightly adjusts the more abstract representations of the pre-trained model, in order to make them relevant for the problem at hand.\\\n",
    "$ $\n",

    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deciding which transfer learning strategy to use \n",
    "Two different transfer learning strategies were presented above. But how do we decide which one to use? The decision is based on two factors: the size of the target (new) dataset (small or big), and its similarity to the source (original) dataset (e.g. ImageNet). Let's discuss four common scenarios and how to navigate among them when choosing  transfer learning strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. size of target dataset is small and similar to source dataset:** In this case, since the size of the new dataset is low, fine tuning can lead to overfitting. As target data is similar to source data, we use the pre-trained model as a feature extractor while changing the output layer according to the new classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Size of the target dataset is small and dissimilar to source data:** In this case we fine tune last layers (including some layers of the convolutional block) while freezing the top layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.Size of the target dataset is large and similar to source data:** In such scenario, the best option would be to fine tune through the complete network of pre-trained model with a small learning rate. Since the target dataset is large, there is less concern of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.Size of the target dataset is large and dissimilar to source data:** Since the target dataset is large, we can  train the neural network from scratch according to our data. However, in practice it is very often still beneficial to initialize with weights from a pre-trained model.\n"

    "First layers of the convolutional base encode more generic, reusable features like  texture, corners, edges and colour blobs, while layers higher up encode more specialized features like  eye, nose, cloth item etc. In order to improve performance of the model  even further we can train (or **fine-tune**) the weights of the top layers of the pre-trained model alongside with training of the classifier we've added. This training process will force the weights to be tuned from generic feature maps to features associated specifically with the dataset we are using. However, we should be careful in choosing how many layers of pre-trained model we want to fine-tune. Pre-trained model has millions of parameters, so more parameters we are training, the more we are at risk of overfitting the training data, especially if our dataset is small.\\\n",
    "Another important thing to remember is that classifier we will be using during fine-tuning should be already trained. If we will add untrained classifier on the top of the model and at the same time will unfreeze few layers of **conv_base**, the error propagating through the network will be too large and will destroy learnt features of unfreezed layers. This is an unwanted outcome, as our aim is to fine-tune (make small changes) the weights of convolutional base and not to learn them from the scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summarizing, the steps for fine-tuning the pre-trained model are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add classifier (dense layers) on the top of the pre-trained model\n",
    "2. Freeze ALL layers of pre-trained model \n",
    "3. Train classifier\n",
    "4. Unfreeze FEW layers of pre-trained model \n",
    "5. Train both, unfreezed layers of convolutional base and classifier"

    "We've already trained our classifier, thus we just need to unfreeze few layers of convolutional base. Specifically, we will  unfreeze last four layers of VGG-16 model **conv_base** (three convolutional + one pool layers). To do so, we first need to unfreeze all layers by setting parameter `trainable` as `True`. Next, we will freeze all layers except last four."

    "- We demonstrated the advantage of transfer learning for smaller data-set applications. By reusing pre-trained model we can get much better accuracy than with classifier trained from scratch.\n",
