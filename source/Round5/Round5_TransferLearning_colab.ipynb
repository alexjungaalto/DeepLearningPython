    "Assume you want to build an app that distinguishes between different dog breeds (see this [overview](https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/profiles)). This can be modeled as a classification problem which we can solve using a deep neural network. Indeed, we could train a deep neural network to predict the dog breed based on a large set of labeled images. The problem is that the amount of labeled images required for accurate training scales with the number of weights (and bias terms) of the deep net. It might well be that we do not have enough training images for some (rare) breeds.\n",

    "Transfer learning is a machine learning technique in which model trained for one particular task is used as a starting point for training model for another task. Transfer learning enables us to utilize the knowledge (such as learned weights, features) from previously learned tasks and apply it to the new, but related task.  \\\n",

Such learned features can be shared across different image classification problems, thus enabling knowledge transfer among them.

    "# Why Transfer Learning ?\n",
    "Deep learning models are data-hungry - they need many training examples to learn the parameters of the network. This is one of the limiting aspects of deep neural networks and that is why the transfer learning comes in handy. Transfer learning is a common and highly effective approach to train the model on a small image dataset by  utilising **pre-trained models**.  Furthermore, transfer learning helps to save the training time, because the model is not trained from scratch. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Pre-trained model** is a deep learning architecture which is trained over a large dataset. Such models are trained for thousands of hours for a given benchmark dataset and all the parameters in the networks are learned. There are numbers of such pre-trained models available and anyone can use them depending on the particular problem. \n",
    "\n",

    "# Key considerations for Transfer Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "To effectively apply transfer learning we need to answer three main questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **What to transfer**: While applying transfer learning we need to understand what knowledge is common between the source and target task. We try to seek answer on what knowledge is specific to source task and what can be transferred from source task to target task that will help improve the performance of the target task. \n",
    "-  **When to transfer**: We should apply transfer learning only when source and target domain are related. When  source and target domains are not related at all, applying transfer learning degrades target task performance. This type of transfer is called Negative Transfer. \n",
    "- **How to transfer**: Once we have answer to what to transfer and when to transfer, we can proceed to identify the actual ways of transferring the knowledge across domains/tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "**So, when does transfer learning makes sense?** \n",

    "2. To fine-tune the pre-trained model \n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-trained Models as a Feature Extractors\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in Round 3, convolutional neural network consists of two parts: first part being the series of  convolutional and pooling layers and second part being densely connected layers. The first part is called **convolutional base**. The main idea of using pre-trained model as feature extractor is to remove a fully connected layer of pre-trained model and use only convolutional base to extract the features from new images.\\\n",
    "These extracted features will be used to train a new classifier for a new task. In this case, we do not retrain pre-trained model or part of it (this is called **freezing** the network), but only train few top dense layers. In other words, the model will only have to learn the weights of the few new dense layers, that are on the top of pre-trained model.\\\n",
    "Figure below demonstrates the concept of feature extraction from pre-trained model and following training of a classifier on top of it. \\\n",
    "For example, if we have a pre-trained model trained on source data like ImageNet database (over 14 million images), we chop off the densely connected layer and use this convolutional base to extract the feature from target data (i.e data for new classification task). Specifically, this means to use the output of convolutional base for training the new (target) model. "

The decision is based on two factors: the size of the target (new) dataset (small or big), and its similarity to the source (original) dataset (e.g. ImageNet). Let's discuss four common scenarios and how to navigate among them when choosing  transfer learning strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. size of target dataset is small and similar to source dataset:** In this case, since the size of the new dataset is low, fine tuning can lead to overfitting. As target data is similar to source data, we use the pre-trained model as a feature extractor while changing the output layer according to the new classification task.\n",

    "\n",

This training process will force the weights to be tuned from generic feature maps to features associated specifically with the dataset we are using. However, we should be careful in choosing how many layers of pre-trained model we want to fine-tune.
